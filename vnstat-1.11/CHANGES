1.11 / 1-Jun-11

 - Fix: Memory allocation was miscalculated when creating interface list from
   /sys/class/net when /proc/net/dev wasn't available which in turn could
   crash the daemon

   (#608963, patch by Mats Erik Andersson)

1.9 / 12-Sep-09

   OutputStyle, SummaryLayout, SummaryRate, SaveOnStatusChange,

   interface1+interface2 syntax
 - -s / --sync parameter added to daemon

 - Outputs now use system locale by default and formatting of dates follow
   the locale setting unless configured otherwise
 - New configuration file settings:
   ShowRate, RateUnit, TrafficlessDays, HourlyRate, TransparentBg


1.7 / 12-Apr-09

 - Fix: Unreadable configuration file doesn't cause a segmentation fault
 - Fix: /proc/net/dev parser didn't see the difference between eth10 and eth1
 - Fix: Updating a database from two of more processes at the same time
   was able to sometimes cause data loss
 - Fix: Estimates are calculated based on last database update
 - Fix: Each interface update had a possibility of losing 1023 bytes of
   traffic at most due to improper rounding
   (Thanks to Michael Berlin for suggesting a suitable correction)
