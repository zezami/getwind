Upgrading from versions 1.1 - 1.9 to 1.11
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

1) Follow the normal install procedure, 'make install' will not overwrite
   your configuration file

2) Generate a new configuration file using current settings in order to 
   get new configuration tags included:

      vnstat --showconfig >/tmp/newconf

   Never overwrite the current configuration file directly! That will 
   result in all previous settings getting replaced by defaults.

3) Check that the configuration settings in /tmp/newconf are correct. If 
   date formatting using system locale is used then use the following 
   settings:

      Locale "-"
      DayFormat    "%x"
      MonthFormat  "%b '%y"
      TopFormat    "%x"
      HeaderFormat "%x %H:%M"

4) Replace the old configuration file:

      mv /tmp/newconf /etc/vnstat.conf

5) If the daemon (vnstatd) is used then restart the daemon after the
   configuration file has been updated.


Upgrading from version 1.0
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 Make a backup of your current database. For the old multiuser install that
 would be /var/spool/vnstat/db and for singleuser it's ~/.vnstatdb
 Copy that file to some other directory that isn't in any relation with
 vnStat. All this is only for backup so the file can be removed once
 1.3 or later has been installed and found working.

 The next thing is to rename that database according to the interface it's
 monitoring. Here's an example if the interface is eth0.

     mv /var/spool/vnstat/db /var/spool/vnstat/eth0

 If there are multiple databases that where used with the -f parameter then
 repeat that procedure for each of of them. In a similar way those using
 the singleuser version would first make a directory labelled '~/.vnstat'
 and move the old database there.

     mv ~/.vnstatdb ~/.vnstat/eth0

 Now your all set to continue the install process like the INSTALL file
 tells. Remember that there's no need to uninstall version 1.0 before
 installing a more recent version.
