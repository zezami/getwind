(Updated 29.5.2011 for version 1.11)


What is vnStat
::::::::::::::

 In short, vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor that uses the
 network interface statistics provided by the kernel as information source.
 This means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also
 ensures light use of system resources. Optional image output is available
 starting from version 1.7.

 See the webpage http://humdi.net/vnstat/ for output examples.


Getting started
:::::::::::::::

 First you should install vnStat. See the INSTALL or INSTALL_BSD file
 depending on used operating system, it contains all needed information
 for the installing process. Instructions for upgrading from a previous
 version are included in the UPGRADE file.


Available options and documentation
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 A list of commonly used options is available with 'vnstat --help'. The
 complete list can be accessed with 'vnstat --longhelp'. The following
 man pages are available with more detailed descriptions:
 
    vnstat          general documentation and console query parameters
	vnstatd         daemon documentation
	vnstati         image output documentation
	vnstat.conf     configuration file


Usage tips
::::::::::

 Most vnStat settings can be changed from the config file. The config
 file is either ~/.vnstatrc or /etc/vnstat.conf depending which one is
 found first. A new config file can be generated using current settings
 with the following command:

    vnstat --showconfig >newconfig

 The config file contains comments before any settings describing with
 the purpose and usage of each setting is. More detailed descriptions
 about each setting and suggested usage can be found from the vnstat.conf
 man page.
